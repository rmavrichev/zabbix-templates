Zabbix template for Procera DPI with script Scheduler and LLD.

contains scripts used for data collection from DPI.

Place this scripts to /zabbix/externalscripts and make it executable.
Python 2.7 with Procera python API ( http://download.proceranetworks.com/python-api.html , version 17.2.0py1 ), and Zabbix trapper (included to Zabbix-agent package) should be installed.

Tested with Zabbix 2.4.7 but also should work with 3.0+.
